MEAN Stack Single Page Application Starter

## What is MEAN ?
The idea is to use a group of technologies which are known to synergize well together, to build a powerfull single page application by using only one language JavaScript.

1. MongoDB as the database
2. Express as the web framework
3. AngularJS as the frontend framework 
4. Node.js as the server platform

How to use it to build any MEAN Stack application ?
